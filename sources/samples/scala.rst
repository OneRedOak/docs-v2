scala-sample
=============
 
This sample will help you get started with Shippable. Testing framework used here is
`ScalaTest <http://scalatest.org/>`_ .

`Scala Sample <https://github.com/Shippable/sample_scala>`_

`Scala Sample with MongoDB <https://github.com/Shippable/sample_scala_mongo>`_

`Scala Sample with PostgreSQL <https://github.com/Shippable/sample_scala_postgres>`_

Keep the test and code coverage output in the special folders Shippable/testresults and Shippable/codecoverage to get the reports parsed. The test report must be in Junit format.

We need the yml file to analyze your project details . So add the shippable.yml file to the root of your repo by specifying :

**language :** Scala is used in this sample project

**version number :** 2.10.2 is the version used in this sample project.

**notification alerts:**  Email notifications are added to get alerts about the build status.


Here is the complete yml file for sample_scala project

.. code-block:: bash

	language: scala
	scala:
    	    - 2.10.2

Enable the repo sample_scala and run it using an Ubuntu minion. Once the build finishes execution, you can check for the console output, test and codecoverage results on the respective build's page.
